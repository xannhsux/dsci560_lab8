## Methodology Comparison

### Word2Vec Bag-of-Bins Approach

**Steps:**
1. Train Word2Vec model (200D) on all words in corpus
   - Creates semantic embeddings for each word
   - Words with similar meanings get similar vectors

2. Cluster word embeddings into k bins using KMeans
   - k = 50, 100, or 200 bins
   - Each word gets assigned to one bin

3. Create document vectors by counting word-to-bin assignments
   - For each document, count how many words fall into each bin
   - Normalize by total number of mapped words
   - Result: Dense k-dimensional vector

**Pros:**
- Interpretable (can trace which words → which bins)
- Semantic grouping (similar words in same bin)
- Fixed dimensionality

**Cons:**
- Information loss from word clustering
- Loses word order and context
- Two-step process (word embeddings → bins → doc vectors)

### Doc2Vec Approach

**Steps:**
1. Train Doc2Vec model directly on documents
   - Learns document vectors jointly with word vectors
   - Uses document context to predict words
   - Document vector participates in training

**Pros:**
- Learns document-level semantics directly
- Captures context and word order
- Holistic document representation
- End-to-end learning

**Cons:**
- Less interpretable (black box)
- Can't easily explain what each dimension means

**Word2Vec Bag-of-Bins:**
```
Dimension    Silhouette    Calinski-Harabasz    Davies-Bouldin
50D          0.0780        44.92                1.9659
100D         0.1152 ↑      40.01 ↓              2.1076 ↓
200D         0.1115 ≈      29.50 ↓              2.3099 ↓

Trend: Silhouette improves, but cluster definition degrades
```

**Doc2Vec:**
```
Dimension    Silhouette    Calinski-Harabasz    Davies-Bouldin
50D          0.1181        75.52                1.7546
100D         0.1442 ↑      76.70 ↑              1.4947 ↑
200D         0.1439 ≈      80.97 ↑              1.4593 ↑

Trend: All metrics improve or maintain with higher dimensions
```

### Key Observations

1. **Word2Vec BoB degrades with dimensionality:**
   - Cluster definition (Calinski-Harabasz) drops from 44.92 → 29.50 (-34%)
   - Cluster overlap increases (Davies-Bouldin gets worse)
   - **Problem:** More bins = more fragmentation of word semantics

2. **Doc2Vec improves with dimensionality:**
   - All metrics improve from 50D → 100D
   - Maintains or improves from 100D → 200D
   - **Benefit:** More capacity to capture document-level semantics

3. **Optimal Configurations:**
   - **Word2Vec BoB:** 100D is best compromise (highest Silhouette: 0.1152)
   - **Doc2Vec:** 100D is optimal (best balance across all metrics)

## Why Doc2Vec Wins

### 1. Direct Document-Level Learning

**Word2Vec BoB:**
```
Words → Word Embeddings → KMeans Clustering → Bins → Count Bins → Doc Vector
  ↑____________Information Loss___________↑
```
- Quantizes continuous word embeddings into discrete bins
- Loses semantic nuances
- Word grouping may not align with document-level semantics

**Doc2Vec:**
```
Documents → Direct Training → Doc Vector
  ↑_______No Information Loss________↑
```
- Learns optimal document representation directly
- No intermediate quantization step
- Document-level optimization

### 2. Context Preservation

**Word2Vec BoB:**
- Treats document as bag of words (no order)
- Word "bank" → same bin whether it's "river bank" or "Chase bank"
- Context lost during word clustering

**Doc2Vec:**
- Uses context windows during training
- Document vector trained to predict words in their context
- Captures semantic relationships specific to document

### 3. Scalability with Dimensions

**Word2Vec BoB Problem:**
```
More bins (200) → Finer word clusters → Sparser document vectors
Example:
  50 bins:  [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, ...]  (dense)
  200 bins: [0.05, 0, 0.03, 0, 0.07, 0, ...] (sparse)
```
- Higher dimensions create sparsity
- Many bins have zero or very few words
- Degrades clustering performance

**Doc2Vec Benefit:**
```
More dimensions → More capacity for semantic nuances
  50D:  Rough document topics
  100D: Detailed semantic representation
  200D: Fine-grained semantic capture
```
- Dense representations at all dimensions
- More dimensions = better semantic capture
- No sparsity issues

## Practical Implications

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Word2Vec Bag-of-Bins if:**
- ✓ You need interpretability (must explain which words drive clustering)
- ✓ You're doing feature engineering for another model
- ✓ You want to inspect which semantic word groups define documents
- ✓ You have limited computational resources (slightly faster)

**Use Doc2Vec if:**
- ✓ **You want best clustering performance** ⭐
- ✓ Accuracy is more important than interpretability
- ✓ You're doing document similarity/retrieval
- ✓ You want to capture document-level semantics
- ✓ You can tolerate "black box" representations

### Recommended Configurations

**If using Word2Vec BoB:**
- Use 100 bins (best balance)
- Don't go beyond 100 bins (performance degrades)
- Consider combining with other features

**If using Doc2Vec:**
- Use 100-200 dimensions (both perform well)
- 100D for balanced performance
- 200D for maximum accuracy
- Less than 100D only if severely resource-constrained

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

1. **Clear Winner:** Doc2Vec outperforms Word2Vec Bag-of-Bins across all dimensions and metrics

2. **Magnitude of Improvement:**
   - Silhouette Score: +25% to +51%
   - Calinski-Harabasz: +68% to +175%
   - Davies-Bouldin: -11% to -37% (lower is better)

### Why the Difference?

**Fundamental Approach:**
- **BoB:** Bottom-up (words → bins → documents)
- **Doc2Vec:** Top-down (documents directly)

**Information Preservation:**
- **BoB:** Quantization losses at each step
- **Doc2Vec:** Direct optimization, no intermediate losses

**Context Handling:**
- **BoB:** Bag-of-words, no context

### Recommendation for Lab Report

**For Question 2 (Word2Vec vs Doc2Vec):**

**Answer:** Doc2Vec is superior for document clustering on this Reddit post dataset, showing 25-175% improvements across clustering quality metrics. While Word2Vec Bag-of-Bins offers interpretability advantages, it suffers from information loss due to word clustering and fails to scale well with higher dimensions. Doc2Vec's direct document-level learning and context preservation make it the recommended choice for document clustering tasks where accuracy is prioritized over interpretability.

**Best Configuration:** Doc2Vec with 100 dimensions (Silhouette: 0.1442, Calinski-Harabasz: 76.70, Davies-Bouldin: 1.4947)
